# recipe_app

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a web application using the Django framework. The backend will store recipes and their respective data, and users will be able to sign up and create their own content, as well as read what is already available. The server is deployed with Heroku, with a Postgres database, HTML, and CSS-based rendered pages at the frontend as well as Python-based Django as the web application framework.
